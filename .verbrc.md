This is completely experimental and pretty hacky. I created this as a proof of concept for another project I'm working on, so it's also limited in scope. Currently, this will only add a single less file at a time, and the formatting and parsing logic are fairly rudimentary.

## Install

## Usage

{%= jscomments("index.js") %}

## Author
{%= include("author") %}

## License

{%= license() %}
